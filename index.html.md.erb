<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) for vCloud Air and vCloud Director is deprecated and availability is restricted to existing customers. Contact <a href="https://pivotal.io/support">Support</a> for more information.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: PCF 1.10 uses SHA-2 certificates and hashes by default. You cannot upgrade existing environments from SHA-1 to SHA-2. Instead, you must install a new environment with PCF 1.10. 

If your deployment does not support SHA-2, use an older version of PCF.</p>
